## What I Did
To get this project started, I broke everything down to smaller chunks. I had a Google doc with an ordered, step-by-step list of what I want to accomplish to bring this online Etch-A-Sketch to life. 

First, I'd need to build the grid. Then moved on to the CHANGE SIZE button. Next was the CLEAR GRID button and finished off with the COLOR PICKER for the "brush".

The grid is the foundation of this program because without it, I can't build other features for the sketchpad. I actually got stuck at this step for many days. But with a little persistence and TONS of Googling, I cracked the code.

With this project, I also took the opportunity to learn more about Git and versions control. For each feature of the program, I had a dedicate Git branch so I could write the code for it. I then merged to the main branch once I finished. I also had a backup branch just in case I messed something up along the way.

I got a chance to brush up on my CSS as well. I learned a few new concepts throughout the project. Things like pseudo classes such as :first-child and :last-child. I also worked hard to improve my Flexbox skills.
